# Building Hardened ISOs

## Workflow
1. Open **ISO Builder**.
2. Choose a distro.
3. Upload a base ISO or provide a URL.
4. Generate a hardened ISO with embedded kickstart/preseed.

## Notes
- RHEL images may require subscription-provided ISOs.
- Ensure kickstart/preseed content aligns with your compliance baseline.
