# Mitigating Hosts

## Workflow
1. Review audit results and failing rules.
2. Open the **Mitigate** page.
3. Provide target hosts, distro, and playbook path.
4. Run with **dry-run** first, then apply fixes.
5. Monitor real-time logs over WebSocket.

## Best Practices
- Use dry-run to preview changes.
- Apply fixes in batches to reduce risk.
- Retest after remediation.
